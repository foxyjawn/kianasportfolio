                            <p>I wrote this essay for my Introduction to Literature class at La Salle University that I took through a dual enrollment program during my junior year of high school. In it, I describe how Chris Drangle’s short story “Exit Music” both follows and breaks the sequence Freytag’s Pyramid establishes with its simultaneous plots. I have always loved literature, so not only was this a good read, but it made me take time to think about the many ways stories are nontraditionally told. This essay demonstrates that deviating from tradition is not always the “wrong” way, and in writing, programming, and life, I needed to acknowledge that. Additionally, I realized that opposites exist to balance and complement each other; innovation and tradition combine in this story to do just that.</p>

                            <p>This essay analyzed the first two chapters of Genesis in the Bible for my Introduction to Social and Political Philosophy course. In class, I learned to interpret the text in a new way that I had never considered before. Growing up in a Christian household and attending a Lutheran school, I had taken everything the Bible said at face value, without considering how ambiguous or metaphorical some parts could be. However, I was very open to seeing the text in new lights that my professor shone. In this essay, I analyze two accounts: the creation of the world and the explanation for the human condition. What you’ll find is that there is a theme in our world of opposites and complementing parts of two.</p>

                            <p>This essay analyzed Polemarchus’s definition of Justice described in Book 1 of Plato’s Republic. I wrote this essay as my second submission for my Introduction to Social and Political Philosophy course. The original paper was my attempt at a new approach to analytical philosophical essays, but I realized I did not structure or detail my analysis enough to present my takeaway impactfully. From my study of the text, it is clear that Socrates concludes that justice is defined by context. From his conversations with Cephalus, Polemarchus, and Thrasymachus, he extracts a double-pronged principle that neither contradicts itself nor proves constant. This resultant boundless idea demonstrates the complexity of philosophy. Sometimes, there are many answers and, therefore, no single answer, which I felt most accurately speaks to the ambiguity of life. </p>

                            <p>I independently coded this website from scratch to house my resource guide, similar to the website you are currently viewing it on. This project was the perfect way for me to practice and express one of my favorite activities: programming. This resource guide is a compilation of resources that can guide me to become a successful software engineer. Throughout the websites, I display a personal statement that describes my passion for software engineering, key terms that are important in the career, physical and digital publications relevant to the practice, and public and on-campus organizations I plan to join to expand my community in the field. This resource guide displays my passion, which makes it the most personal piece of the entire portfolio.</p>
