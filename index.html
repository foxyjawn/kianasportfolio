	<p>My final portfolio displays three essays that, on the surface, contrast vastly with the resource guide. The three essays within themselves maintain a theme of ambiguity and how it creates duality. “Genesis” introduces every dual part of our known world and how opposite forces are needed to create balance. “Exit Music” details how an author combines the “right” and “wrong” methods of storytelling to create a unified story with dual timelines. Polemarchus’s Definition of Justice analyzes one side of an age-old debate that does not confirm nor contradict its contending argument. The final solution is that no single statement defines justice because both definitions could occasionally be true or false. All three essays explore how two parts of a whole function to create a dual existence, and at the same time, emphasize that ambiguity is constant in life. There is not always one answer.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, my resource guide details a career in problem-solving; identifying a problem and its solution is essential to success. However, even with programming, there is never one method to finding that answer. There is often not even one solution. There are multiple ways to code any task and numerous ways to solve any software issue. All of these works come together to illuminate how ambiguity and duality harmonize life. I instantly recognized the theme of two parts that appeared in each essay, but I did not realize this theme matched my resource guide until I thought deeply about the process of coding. Computer programming is often thought of as a very scientific job involving a lot of mathematics. Usually, math is considered a non-creative subject, where there are right and wrong answers. This perception of my passion compared to the open interpretation of literature and philosophy seemed directly contrasting.</p>
<p>However, I thought about how wrong the assumption is that programming is not creative. When considering the actual thought processes that I have when attempting any coding challenge or task, I recognized how free the practice is. There is never one way to build any software, making programming just as creative and personal as literature and philosophy. Programming is about using tools to create new things. Additionally, there are many programming languages, and, just as literature and philosophy show, language is ambiguous. There are hundreds of ways to say hello in different languages. As someone who values balance and fairness but is always worried about not going about things the “right” way, the realization of this theme reflects the understanding I want to maintain throughout my life. I strive to remain comfortable in the world’s balance. I know that there must be sadness to appreciate happiness and failure to enjoy success. The good in the world combats the bad, and deviating from the norm is not taking the “wrong” route. Keeping this understanding, I balance my life by welcoming ambiguity and appreciating the duality of the world.
